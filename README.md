# LincPlus LincStation N2 Driver

I have been using the [LincPlus LincStation N2](https://www.lincplustech.com/products/lincstation-n2-network-attached-storage "https://www.lincplustech.com/products/lincstation-n2-network-attached-storage") since it was released.

Unfortunately, LincPlus does not offer the drivers for the N2 for download as they do for the [N1](https://www.lincplustech.com/pages/download "https://www.lincplustech.com/pages/download").

Therefore I have extracted the necessary drivers and files for the N2 from their official [Unraid installation image](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d4c6cZ6rMwdDipX8VSftbt2vPmiv6F94/view?usp=drive_link "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d4c6cZ6rMwdDipX8VSftbt2vPmiv6F94/view?usp=drive_link") and made them available here.

**Just to clarify: I am in no way affiliated with [LincPlus](https://www.lincplustech.com/ "https://www.lincplustech.com/"), I only use the LincStation N2 as an end user.**
